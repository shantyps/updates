## Skilling Havens

Skilling havens in Shanty serve as the central place for players to be able to train respective skills and gather resources for it. We have some scarcity present in the higher level resources in light of our planned additions to the Wilderness. However, we don't plan on necessarily limiting things to the Wilderness, doing so will surely have benefits for players. We'll expand on this aspect in the future.

![The Fishing Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/fishing-haven-map.png)

### Fishing Haven

The Fishing Haven can be easily reached from the mine cart travelling system. The Fishing Haven contains the following resources:
<!-- more -->
- 2 Anglerfish (1 concurrent)
- 4 Shark / Bass (2 concurrent)
- 5 Monkfish / Swordfish / Tuna (3 concurrent)
- 4 Leaping trout / Leaping salmon / Leaping sturgeon (3 concurrent)
- 4 Trout / Salmon / Pike (2 concurrent)
- 4 Shrimps / Anchovies / Sardine / Herring (2 concurrent)

We'd love to hear if these numbers sound good to you or not in the comments. There exists a Monkfish spawn near the bank at the Fishing Haven. There also exists a Shark spawn that is not too far from the bank. The Anglerfish spawn is a little bit of a walk to get to the bank.

#### Fishing Haven - Main Dock

The main dock of the Fishing Haven hosts a wide array of fish to catch from. Power trainers can enjoy the barbarian fishing, while beginners can start training with the Shrimps. There also exists a Shark spawn here that is relatively close to the bank.

![The Fishing Tutor at the main dock of the Fishing Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/fishing-tutor.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--left"}{:width="50"}
The Fishing tutor also exists on this dock. He exists to provide basic resources for Fishing. He is not limited to just beginners however, as talking to him as you progress Fishing will yield more gear from him.

For example, if you are level 1 at Fishing, he will give you a Fishing net. At level 5, if you talk to him again, he will give you a Fishing rod and some Fishing bait. These resources are distributed all the way up to level 82, where he will give resources for catching Anglerfish. It is important to note that he will only give these basic resources once.

![Captain Tock at the main dock of the Fishing Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/captain-tock.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--left"}{:width="50"}
Captain Tock lives on the dock as well. Talking to him will lead to a dialogue about Captain Tock talking about how life at sea is freedom, and how everything in his house he got from life at sea.

One such artifact is a portrait of [King Vallance][king-vallance], who he hints is from the Kingdom of Asgarnia. The player, of course, remarks that he has never heard of that kingdom.

![Captain Janaway's house at the Fishing Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/janaway-house.png)

#### Fishing Haven - Captain Janaway's House

Captain Janaway's house hosts higher level Fishing resources like the only Anglerfish spawn.

![Captain Janaway at his house in the Fishing Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/janaway.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--left"}{:width="50"}
*"There is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea."*

Captain Janaway lives here with his wife, Anja (sorry Hengel). Talking to him will reveal his pessimism towards the life at sea and how the sea's only purpose is malice. He is the polar opposite of Captain Tock.

He will also mention that he has a son who is a student of the Fishing Master. According to him, his son accidentally caught a Shark bare-handed when he was younger, and wants to learn how to master that skill from the Fishing Master. **Players can only catch fish bare-handed after talking to his son.**

Upstairs, 2 beds exist; one is for Janaway and his wife, and the other for his son. Anja can be talked to here for a short dialogue about how she believes her son will be a master himself one day.

#### Fishing Haven - Fishing Master

The Fishing Master exists to give the Fishing skillcape. At Shanty, we plan on incorporating all the skill masters rather than going with the regular, mundane approach of all skillcapes in one shop.

The Fishing Master's student is Captain Janaway's son. He often makes trips to the main dock to train his Fishing skill, then makes his way back to the Fishing Master and asks for his input. Speaking to him at the appropriate level can lead to him teaching you (accidentally) how to fish bare-handed.

![The Woodcutting Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/woodcutting-haven.gif)

### Woodcutting Haven

The Woodcutting Haven can be reached by travelling just west of Shanty City. The Woodcutting Haven contains the following resources:

- 2 big Redwood trees
- 5 Magic trees
- 6 Yew trees 
- 6 Mahogany trees 
- 5 Teak trees 
- 4 Maple trees 
- 7 Willow trees 
- 5 Oak trees 
- Many regular trees and evergreens

We'd love to hear if these numbers sound good to you or not in the comments. All of these except teak trees exist pretty close to a bank. Regardless of that fact, we will still make incentives for people to cut trees in the Wilderness for financial gain.

#### Woodcutting Haven - Cutting Trees

![The Woodsman tutor in the Woodcutting Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/woodsman-tutor.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--left"}{:width="50"}
![Hickton in the Woodcutting Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/hickton.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--left"}{:width="50"}
The Woodsman tutor and Hickton exist to give skillcapes for their respective skills (Woodcutting and Fletching).

Occasionally, you can find Hickton punching a tree and fletching the logs he has to refine his skills.

These two will have students soon as well.

![The Foresters in the Woodcutting Haven in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/forester.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--left"}{:width="50"}
Along with you, there are two young foresters chopping trees. Here, Harry met Lloyd, and they harmoniously chop some trees together (to fund for their condo in Hawaii).

*I guess Shanty Island's desert area [kinda looks like Hawaii][hawaii]?*

<sub>*Ok I guess not really.*</sub>

#### Woodcutting Haven - Perry's Chop-chop Shop

Here, players can buy axes up to rune to chop-chop their wood!

## God Wars Dungeon

We've been working on God Wars Dungeon more since the last update, including adding the fighting, adding killcounts, and adding the shortcuts to places. Zaros is still not developed, but will be soon.

![An example of caves being named as to where they go in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-3/named-objects.gif)

## Quality-of-Life Improvements

We did some quality improvements. Namely, we renamed cave entrances to denote where they lead to, fixed our backend code for projectiles so they more accurately fire from a monster, and other miscellanious things.

Thanks for reading our first update post! Our custom Village of Shadows, Blast Furnace, Barrows, our custom Silesse Town, Dense runestone mining, and some progress on emulating Tick Manipulation were made and are still a work-in-progress.
