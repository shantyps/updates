For the past month, we've been focusing on polishing our server. This includes features like doors, ladders, rewriting consumables for proper combo-eating, adding support for venom, stamina potions, and putting more emphasis on in-game sound effects to existing content.

Another focus of ours during this time has been adding life to our island. We have started writing some lore pertaining Shanty Island for us to be able to ensure the world is one coherent entity.

Finally, our focus content-wise has been on Slayer. Here's what we've been working on.

## Vorkath

<sub>Yes, Arham absolutely sucks at PvM. But hey, give him a break, he's using a laptop and all. </sub>

Vorkath is the next major Slayer boss we have worked on (the last one was Abyssal Sire). We sent many accounts in the real OSRS to meet their demise while studying the mechanics of the boss. We do this for many aspects of the server to make sure we can provide the best quality content to match OSRS. With that being said, we aim to make the projectiles even smoother in the future.

## God Wars Dungeon Bosses

The bosses for God Wars Dungeon have been made! As per our policy when making monsters, we ensure that every item a monster drops is usable. So, making godswords, and other precious drops are functioning as well.

We'll soon be adding the battle of the factions and the individual courses to access the eyries. We will be making kill counts required to start killing the respective bosses.

## Here Be Crabs

This is where new players can train their accounts for some beginning EXP. The shortest way to get here will be taking a cart to the Fishing Haven, then making your way there.

All these optimal routes to locations and guides will be made sure to be in a central wiki so no pirate gets lost in their travels.

We hope you all get [the naming reference][here-be-penguins]. By the way, this is also where Maximax lives.

## More Slayer Monsters

Slayer continues to be at the top of our content list. There's still a decent amount of monsters left to do.
