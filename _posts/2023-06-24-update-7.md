## Verdant Domains

The Verdant Domains on Shanty Island are teeming with lush greenery and a diverse population. Despite its natural beauty, conflicts are common in this region, as is the case wherever humans coexist.

As of the beginning of the game, it has been 18 years since a pirate ship crashed on the northern beach of the Verdant Domains, leaving behind a peculiar crew of humans and dwarves. The pirates mercilessly attacked their 
captives, but halted their pursuit when they witnessed a miraculous event—an uprising of the earth that allowed the escapees to flee towards the desert.

Present-day Shanty remains under the control of the pirates, with their stronghold known as Shanty City continuously growing stronger. They established connections with the mainland through bribes to a Menaphite crew, 
attracting merchants and mercenaries to the city alongside the pirates themselves. Throughout the region, players will discover various points of interest such as the city, dungeons, and training nodes, all of which play a 
vital role in their adventure in Shanty.

### Verdant Domains - Shanty City

Shanty City is the main course of the action! In it, you can expect to see all the typical home functions to give you the convenience an RSPS provides.

![Shanty City Main Square](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/shanty-city-main-square.png)

#### Shanty City - Main Square

In this new iteration of the city, the town square is much more compact and much less open. A great deal of utility has been placed within arm's reach, and the closed-off arrangement keeps the player's navigation options 
limited to make the city easy to navigate.

![Shanty City Marketplace](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/shanty-city-marketplace.png)

#### Shanty City - Marketplace

Exiting the town square by the northern exit, there is a marketplace that will take up the city's top left portion, featuring a variety of stalls as well as mercenaries (as pickpocket substitutes for the Knights of Ardougne) 
and guards.

![Shanty City The Alley](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/shanty-city-the-alley.png)

#### Shanty City - The Alley

In the top middle, an alley leads into the pet insurer and the taxidermist, two lesser but still essential utilities that are better placed in Shanty City rather than elsewhere. There’s also the cemetery, where a corrupted 
fairy ring will be available for travel into the Wilderness Realm.

![Shanty City The Shopside](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/shanty-city-shopside.png)

#### Shanty City - The Shopside

Exiting the town square through the east exit is where Shanty City offers everything else you’d want out of a typical starter town, but now located across the span of a much smaller area to make for a more digestible 
familiarization experience.

Going clockwise from the town square exit, there’s:

- The local POH portal
- Shanty City Arms For Close-Up Doohickey (& Slayer Master right across)
- Shanty City Arms For Faraway Hittin’
- The Servants’ Guild
- Shanty City Gear For Staying Lively And Chippy
- Warding Workshop (& Achievements Master right across)
- Mage of Zamorak
- Shanty City Mystiques For Arcanistry & Blitzin'
- Unlockable access to Abandoned Keep (& Thurgo’s smithy right across)
- Estate Agent

![Shanty City Monolith of Air](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/shanty-city-monolith-of-air.png)

#### Shanty City - Monolith of Air

Right beside the city, through the back exit of the Warding Workshop, the Monolith of Air sits on its own cliff no longer bloating the city itself while remaining within arm’s reach.

![Shanty City Port Shanty](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/shanty-city-port-shanty.jpg)

#### Shanty City - Port Shanty

Just outside the city walls is Port Shanty, which features access to overseas travel; one ship to Void Knights' Outpost, one boat to Waterbirth Isle and Ungael, and room to spare for more in the future.

The port also features a pub called **The Yapping Werestool**, a name that stems from a joke among the pirates that the curse that has befallen the dwarves in the mire would turn them into stools, which in turn comes from 
the pirates' use of "stool" as a derogatory term for dwarves.

</video>

### Verdant Domains - Woodcutting Haven

To the west of the city is the Woodcutting Haven. It is to feature just about every type of tree, now including Sullisceps too (in the enclosure to the far left). The haven also features a sawmill for turning logs into planks.

### Verdant Domains - Port Pallente & Fishing Haven

Port Pallante is a small seaside settlement serving as a base for mercenaries and fishing workers under the employ of Almirante Pallante, the head honcho of Shanty Island's pirates. It features a bank, a Farming patch, and a 
fishing shop, along with a new low-level rooftop course and a new POH portal. Nearby, the Fishing Haven offers a serene fishing experience while conserving map space and serving as a convenient departure point for voyages to 
Lake Molch and Angler's Outpost.

</video>

### Verdant Domains - Monolith of Water

The Monolith of Water is to become a bigger and more embellished set piece, standing atop a tall cliff that towers over the rest of the tropical area. No other changes planned besides aesthetics and the addition of a few NPCs 
nearby.

### Verdant Domains - Here be Crabs

The crabs are still doing their thing, except they're now found a bit closer to the city just off the docks of Port Shanty.

</p>

## Mage Arena 2

The sequel to [the first Mage Arena](/updates/update-5) miniquest has been implemented now! Track down and defeat three powerful god followers—Porazdir, Justiciar Zachariah, and Derwen—as they roam the Wilderness Realm! 
Collect their remains and return them to Kolodion to imbue your god cape, unlocking its true potential. Utilize the power of the gods and powerful weaponry to overcome these adversaries!

## Bryophyta

<p float="middle">
  <img src="/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/bryophyta-entrance.png" alt="Entering the fight against Bryophyta in Shanty RSPS in the Varrock Sewers" width="500" />
  <img src="/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/bryophyta.png" alt="Fighting Bryophyta in Shanty RSPS in the Varrock Sewers" width="500" /> 
</p>

Bryophyta, the formidable Moss Giant boss! (Lol maybe if you're F2P.) To access her lair located in the Varrock Sewers, you'll need a mossy key, obtainable by slaying any Moss Giant or purchasing from other players. Once inside, 
be prepared for a fight where every encounter is instanced, risking the loss of all your items upon death.

Bryophyta utilizes both melee and magic attacks, adapting to the distance between you and her. Beware as she occasionally summons up to three growthlings, which can only be eliminated using secateurs or a bronze axe. 
Don't worry if you forget your secateurs, as a pile of logs west of the instanced map provides a handy bronze axe.

Remember, Bryophyta remains invincible until all three growthlings have been defeated. However, emerging victorious might grant you her essence, a valuable resource used to craft and charge Bryophyta's staff!

![Shanty Cerberus](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/cerberus.png)

## Cerberus

Cerberus, the Hellhound Boss, has emerged from the depths of the Taverley dungeon. Only those with 91 Slayer and a hellhound or Cerberus task are deemed worthy of facing this fearsome creature.

___

![Shanty Slayer Rewards](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-7/slayer-rewards.gif)

## Slayer Rewards

We've implemented a good portion of the slayer rewards now, including (but not limited to) fighting superior versions of bosses, getting boss slayer tasks, extending slayer tasks, skipping slayer tasks, blocking slayer tasks, and storing slayer tasks for later!

## Thieving - Blackjacking & Custom Stalls

Lastly, we've implemented more features to the Thieving skill, including some custom stalls we have devised along with the ability to blackjack NPCs.

Thanks for reading our seventh update post! The SOMA Lookout, a small expansion of Angler's Outpost, more work on the Wilderness Realm, Farming, and Alchemical Hydra were also worked on and are still a work-in-progress.
