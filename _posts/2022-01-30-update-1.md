## The Abattoir

The Abattoir, also known as the slaughterhouse, hosts the monsters that are invading Shanty Island and have not settled on our lands. From a RuneScape player's perspective, these monsters are the "useless" monsters. That is, it hosts Slayer monsters that are not likely to be killed outside of a Slayer task. This area serves as a means for the player to be able to find these tasks in an easier-to-find, central location.

Outside, the dungeon to kill NPCs, there hosts a conflict between Guards and various invading NPCs.

We will explore on how to expand the Abattoir's functions. Please comment in this thread if you have any ideas!

## The Warriors' Guild

Let's be real, the only room most people use are the Animation rooms, the top floor, and the basements. After recognizing this, we decided to size down the Warriors' guild to functionally have these 3 areas.

The Animation room is just as it was before. We're looking into expanding it to have support for dragon armour now that dragon armour is now a full set in OSRS. Why? Because why not!

The top floor and basement Cyclops will be hosted in a newly made dungeon. Functionally, these Cyclops are just as they are in OSRS: a means to get the defenders. We will be expanding the existing Cyclops cave, shown in the image above, to include Lorelei and her higher leveled Cyclops monsters as well.

## The Abyssal Sire

We've been pushing through with Slayer for a while now. We are now at a state where we are making the boss equivalents of the Slayer tasks to allow alternative methods to complete tasks. Right now, the Abyssal Sire - the Abyssal Demon boss - is an example of this in action.

We haven't finished the Sire yet as there is much polishing left to do.
