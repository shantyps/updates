## Village of Shadows

The outcasts of a civilization tend to often have sorrowful histories... and none more so in Shanty Island than that of the dwarves. When the initial inhabitants of Shanty Island came, dwarves accompanied them. Due to the unequal dynamics of power and discrimination, many dwarves were forced to live in the Village of Shadows, located in the Thyrsus Mire.

Living here comes with a cruel curse. What's the curse? The curse is that the inhabitants can't stand sunlight.

We've spent a couple of months working on this village. **Over 50 custom models were made** for NPCs, objects, and items just for this village. Each NPC carefully had their dialogue crafted; each object had much thought put into it; and each item had fashionscape kept in mind. We really hope you guys like how it turned out. Also, a special shoutout to Maximax for a lot of the exhaustive planning that went into all of this.

### Village of Shadows - Barrows

The Barrows brothers rest to the right of the village. We have made good progress on barrows and just have polishing left to do such as edge cases when multiple brothers are not killed and the player is in the tunnels, finalizing the doors for the puzzle (the puzzle has been made), and such.

As such, our Barrows minigame will be just like that of OSRS with puzzles, killing all 5 brothers, and so on and so forth.

![The Crafting Guild in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/crafting-guild.png)

### Village of Shadows - Crafting Guild

The Crafting Guild hosts an enhanced pottery wheel, spinning weel, and furnace (for up to gold ore). If you have suggestions for further enhancements, let us know!

*"The fate of our village depends on it."*

Here, you can find Master Crafter Mariana, who is Shanty's new Crafting master. She informs you of what the amenities of the guild are. You can also talk to her to receive the Crafting cape. She'll have a student made soon.

Outside the guild, you can find Catalina's "live"stock. She tells you about how the undead cows are a food source for the village because of a sorceress who lives in Silesse Town. She insists that rot is "tasty..."

![Krystilia in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/krystilia.png)

### Village of Shadows - Krystilia's Camp

We have talked many times about our plans for Slayer, including the custom Abattoir area and having support for multiple masters all in one location. Krystilia, however, is an exception to all this. We have a deep desire to maintain Wilderness activity, and one step in that direction is keeping Krystilia separate from our planned Slayer changes.

Near Krystilia, we have a sneakpeek of another idea we have to maintain Wilderness activity: the corrupt fairy ring network. We will be having a **Wilderness realm**, which is to be a separate realm from regular Shanty Island. You may remember our plans for an underground wilderness; we have instead opted for a new "realm" for the wilderness instead to give it an otherworldly feel. We will have more information on the Wilderness realm in the future.

![The Tyrant's Damnation Pub in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/pub.png)

### Village of Shadows - Tyrant's Damnation Pub

When dwarves initially came to the village, Tyrant's Damnation was a place that hosted a bunch of valuable items left behind the dwarves' unknown predecessors. After getting a valuation of the valuable assets from somebody from the main city, they sold the items for a pretty penny and turned the place into a pub, as dwarves should. The pirates gave the guy who gave them that valuation a beating and the name "Pirate's Damnation" came to fruition. However, after Abraham, the bartender, loathed the idea of having pirates let alone be in the name of their establishment, he settled with the name Tyrant's Damnation.

The pub hosts a new beverage in Shanty: Triumph blaze. It also sells regular, boring beer as well. 

Emil and Gregor can also be found in the pub with their own comical dialogue. One of our favorites:

*Emil*: This isn't the right day for small talk.

*Player*: I thought you dwarves were all small talk.

Of course, Emil isn't too happy to hear that...

### Village of Shadows - Ganlow's Garment Grove

Here, you can find unique garments to dress your character with. While a lot of them have a feminine focus, anyone is free to wear them. (: These costumes are meant to provide something fresh and new for those into cosplay and general fashionscape! They are called "Debonair" costumes. We will eventually add regular fashionscape apparel soon.

![Town Square at Village of Shadows in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/town-square.png)

### Village of Shadows - Town Square

Meet Leonard - the Village of Shadows' fierce fighter. He holds the esteemed Shinespire weapon. This weapon was what helped dwarves drive out the ghasts in the village. He stands guard at the village's entrance to keep ghasts out of the village's premises.

To the north of Town Square, the cart transportation network can be found. This cart transportation network, shown many times before, connects important areas in Shanty Island together.

### Village of Shadows - What's left?

#### Village of Shadows - Remaining Shops

We have two shops that remain to be developed. These shops are Werton's Gemstones and Uriah's Herblore Shop.

![Sisterhood Sanctuary at Village of Shadows in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/sisterhood-sanctuary.png)

#### Village of Shadows - Sisterhood Sanctuary

The Sisterhood Sanctuary is yet to be developed in Shanty RSPS, but it will be hosted at the Village of Shadows.

![Hallowed Sepulchre at Village of Shadows in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/hallowed.png)

#### Village of Shadows - Hallowed Sepulchre

The Hallowed Sepulchre minigame is yet to be developed in Shanty RSPS, but it can be found at the Village of Shadows.

![Church at Village of Shadows in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/altar.png)

#### Village of Shadows - Church

We still have to finalize plans for the church lore-wise soon for the Village of Shadows. For now, we can admire our custom glass painting!

## Slayer Tower

From a RuneScape player's perspective, the monsters hosted in this tower are all supposed to be "useful" monsters that people would wish to pursue outside of task. According to Shanty's lore, the Slayer Tower is the only place in the overworld that invading monsters successfully have taken over. This is located in the Thyrsus Mire like the Village of Shadows.

Mercy is a lone sorceress who lives in Shanty's version of the Slayer Tower. She is a character of great lore significance -meaning she will play into more than one quest if Shanty makes it that far- who possesses a great deal of power. She's actually the reason why the events of the game take place, as she moved the ocean's waves to crash the ship whose crew and hostages went on to populate the mysteriously uninhabited Shanty Island.

Both King Waldo and Maximax worked hard in making the new Slayer tower. King Waldo was looking to make a more monastery look to the tower to make it look more forboding. Later on, Maximax took liberty in expanding the tower's floor plan a bit to fit more monsters.

## Pet Insurance

Located in Shanty City (the home area) right at the town center, Probita can be found to ensure pets.

![Taxidermist in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-4/taxidermist.png)

## Taxidermist

Located in Shanty City near Port Shanty, the Taxidermist can be found to stuff heads for the skilling hall! Ava can also be found here to sell her devices.

## Kalphite Queen

The great Kalphite Queen rules her reign in the Bezalis Desert. We have implemented various mechanics such as how she switches on players, her protection prayers affecting accuracy, the Kalphites hatching from the walls, and more. We still have some tweaking to do with formulas for her, but she is looking good!

## Duel Arena

Yeah, pirates like the sand casino. We're bringing the joy of ~~gambling your life savings away in a medieval, click-and-go fantasy game that has been revamped to be in a pirate theme~~ skillfully challenging other players to a duel in the Town of Luce. We have reduced the size of the Duel Arena down to just 1 of the big arena sections in an effort to conserve space. We're aware that this could possibly pose an issue if there are too many players dueling concurrently - especially to NH stakers - and have plans to extend another arena if the need arises.

Thanks for reading our fourth update post! The Wilderness Realm, the corrupt fairy ring system, the Hunter Haven, the Hunter skill, and the hunting aspects of our Warding skill had progress in this update as well and are still a work-in-progress.
