Hey everyone! It's been a while but rest assured that development has in fact been moving forward. We have attained a pace where our update blogs can continue to be posted on a monthly basis, so that we won't have you guys 
waiting around for too long (hopefully!). With that said, let's get to this month's update.

## Wilderness Realm

For a while now, a decent amount of our efforts have gone into pushing the Wilderness closer and closer to completion. For starters, we have finally addressed the one major predicament that Shanty has faced in this regards 
due to the project's nature.

The fact that Shanty takes place in a new overworld away from the Gielinor mainland has long begged the question: What should be done about the Wilderness? The solution we ultimately committed to is that the Wilderness of 
Shanty exists as its own landmass, sitting somewhere in the high seas, somewhere in the far reaches of another realm. Because of this, the Wilderness cannot be reached by foot, instead requiring the use of corrupted fairy 
rings located throughout Shanty Island.

Beyond the location and means of access, not much is changed about the gameplay of the Wilderness. As a result of it no longer being attached to the Gielinor mainland, though, a decent amount of work had to go into adjusting 
the western and southern edges of the landmass. Huge shouts to its.teewhy for that!

### Wilderness Realm - The Ruined Outpost

While the Wilderness itself hasn't changed very much, we did toss out Edgeville by necessity. In its place is the Ruined Outpost, a neat little facility that we put in place to serve as a hub right by the ditch. This is the 
only non-PvP location that corrupted fairy rings provide access to within the confines of the Wilderness Realm.

### Wilderness Realm - PvP Death Mechanics

Death is a complicated matter with a growing and changing repertoire of rules and exceptions. There are various mechanics which are specific to PvP deaths in the Wilderness, and as of currently we have managed to implement 
what includes but is not limited to:

- Untradeable items that are dropped as coins on death
- Untradeable items that remain for the victim of death to pick up freely
- Untradeable items that become broken on death below Wilderness level 20
- Looting bag always disappears on death, its contents wholly unprotected
- Food and potions stored in a looting bag disappear completely
- The bracelet of ethereum becomes uncharged, the ether stored within dropped along with the bracelet itself
- The toxic blowpipe becomes uncharged, the scales and darts stored within dropped along with the weapon itself
- The slayer helmet becomes a black mask instead 

In the future, we will also be implementing the recent addition of loot keys.

### Wilderness Realm - Wilderness Slayer

As we established previously, Wilderness slayer tasks will offer all the same dangerous Slayer opportunities as always, since there is no need for the measures we had to take to make Slayer work in our custom overworld. 
Wilderness slayer tasks can be received from -you guessed it- Krystilia, who resides near a corrupted fairy ring in the south-eastern region of Shanty Island.

Kills only count towards your task progress in the Wilderness, task streaks are tracked separately from regular tasks, sometimes you might get Larran's keys. You know how this goes unless you don't play OSRS very much.

### Wilderness Realm - The Mage Arena

It's everyone's favorite miniquest! You have to know the drill for this one by now, right?

![The muddy chest in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/best-feature.gif)

### Wilderness Realm - Muddy Chest

The muddy chest! Indeed, this is certainly a noteworthy addition.

![The Chaos Altar in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/chaos_altar.gif)

### Wilderness Realm - The Chaos Altar

The chaos altar sitting at Wilderness level 38 has had its prayer training functionality implemented. Bones offered here grant x3.5 times the usual experience, with a 50% chance per action that the bones will not be consumed 
in the process. Noted bones can be exchanged for unnoted ones by paying 50 coins per note to the friendly fellow in red robes sitting just outside the temple.

![The conflict within in the Wilderness God Wars Dungeon in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/wilderness_gwd.gif)

### Wilderness Realm - God Wars Dungeon

The Wilderness GWD is now implemented with all of its unique features. Two different entryways allow for accessing the place from different points, foes in this dungeon are aggressive to NPCs and players who are not of the same 
allegiance, and of course, the coveted ecumenical keys can be obtained here.

### Wilderness Realm - Wilderness Slayer Cave

The Wilderness Slayer Cave is another notable dungeon that we have implemented in our quest to finalise the Wilderness. Foes found here are stronger variants of the ones found elsewhere in the Wilderness, and they all have a 
chance to drop tertiary drops which draw from a specialized loot table. In addition to this, foes killed here whilst on a slayer task will drop Larran's keys more often, and foes with a Slayer level requirement also require a 
slayer task in order to attack them.

### Wilderness Realm - Bosses

**Note: Callisto was shown in [Update #2](https://shanty.ps/updates/update-2)**

The Wilderness wouldn't be what it is without its selection of iconic bosses! We have taken care of implementing all of the mechanics for these boss fights which include...

![The Crazy Archaelogist in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/archaeologist.gif)

#### Crazy Archaelogist‎‏‏

Tile-targeted AoE attack, incessant yelling.

![The Chaos Fanatic in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/fanatic.gif)

#### Chaos Fanatic

Tile-targeted AoE attack, ludicrously incessant yelling, disarm attack.

![Vet'ion in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/vetion.gif)

#### Vet'ion

Two phases, tile-targeted AoE attack, earthquake AoE attack, minions appear based on HP threshold, immunity to all damage while minions are alive.

![Venenatis in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/venenatis.gif)

#### Venenatis

Prayer drain attack, ball of web attack, multi-target magic attack, long-ranged melee attack, damage soaking whilst in single-way combat areas.

![Chaos Elemental in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/elemental.gif)

#### Chaos Elemental‎‏‏‎

Random damage type attack, disarm attack, teleport attack.

![The Wilderness Realm Achievement Diary in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/wilderness_achievements.png)

### Wilderness Realm - Achievement Diary

By the way, we have started to work on Shanty's Achievement Diaries! The Wilderness Diary in particular will remain in its vanilla state for the most part, but rewards might see a number of changes to make them a little less 
underwhelming.

## Edgeville Dungeon Changes

The Edgeville Dungeon is something we've been meaning to add to Shanty Island, but the uncertainty regarding what we should do about the Wilderness posed a bit of a roadblock until recently. Now that we have decided to make 
the Wilderness into a separate realm, we plan on separating the Wilderness section of the Edgeville Dungeon from the rest of the thing, connecting both sections via the corrupt fairy ring network instead.

As shown in the image, we also took the opportunity to merge the dungeon with the Moss giants area just beyond, and we ditched the rest of the Varrock Sewers because it held nothing that was worth the hassle of figuring out 
where the sewer's exits would lead to. We only have so much room for dungeon entrances in our overworld, after all, and we do care about ensuring it bears an organic flair to some degree.

![A minimap of the Duel Realm in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/duel_realm.png)

## The Duel Realm

While we intend to keep the Duel Arena around in Shanty, its size makes it way too big for our overworld! Because of this, we have decided to shove the whole thing into its own non-overworld section of the Bezalis Desert (a 
region you will be seeing more of in next month's update!). This map was made by Maximax, who may or may not have spent several hours deeply entranced as he placed all of those out-of-bounds cacti and cliff edges.

![Waterbirth Island in Shanty RSPS](/updates/assets/images/posts/update-5/waterbirth.gif)

## Waterbirth Island

Waterbirth Island has been added to the world map. Since it's pretty far north into the ocean, Sino decided it would be appropriate to edit the place a bit to reflect how much colder it would be, and Maximax put in the work 
needed to make that happen.

As for the island's dungeon, we intend to implement all of it (no quick entry straight to DKs! (unless you get some achievements done)). It currently sits in a work-in-progress state, but we can handily develop it to completion 
before long.

Thanks for reading our fourth update post! Our premium shop stock system, Bezalis Desert - including the Mining Haven, Construction, some Warding interfaces, and other smaller features were developed in this update as well and 
are still a work-in-progress.
